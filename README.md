# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This site showcases my work, experience, and projects. You can check it out live at [www.vito-medlej.com](http://www.vito-medlej.com).

## What's Inside

- **Main Site:** A clean and simple portfolio.
- **3D Version (/3d):** An interactive 3D room built using **Three.js** + **Blender**. You can walk around and explore the room. There’s even a video screen in the room (needs a bit of work).
- **Animations:** Smooth animations using **GSAP**.
- **Smooth Scrolling:** Easy to integrate smooth scrolling if that’s your thing.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** – For the main website and routing.
- **Three.js** + **Blender** – Powering the 3D room on `/3d`.
- **GSAP** – For animations throughout the site.
- **Smooth Scrolling:** Ready for integration (WIP).

## Status

This is a **free** personal project, use it as your own, but apperciate letting me know at LinkedIn. The 3D room at `/3d` is very simple, you could create & add your own Blender room very easily.
